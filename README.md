# Prework Study Guide

## Description

The Prework Study Guide website is a resource that contains basic information about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The purpose of this study-aid is to reflect on previous
information gathered throughout the pre-work assignment. This allows anyone utilizing this website to quickly verify information they may have forgotten at a glance. Through the creation of this website, I've learned how all four topics covered in these notes work together to make a final product.
